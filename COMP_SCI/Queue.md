# What is **Queue**

![[Queue-Data-structure1.png]]

A **Queue*** is defined as a linear data structure that is open at both ends and the operations are performed in **First In First Out (FIFO)*** order.

- ## **Queue** Structure
	
	with[[LINKED LIST | Linked List]]
	
```c++

```
	
	with `Array`
	
```c++
struct Queue{
	int Size;
	int Front=-1;
	int Rear=-1;
	int *Q;
}
```

- ## **Queue** Implementation
	- Using [[Queue with array | Array]]
	- Using [[Queue with LL | Linked List]]
	go to [[LINKED LIST| LL]]
