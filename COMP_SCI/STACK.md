- ##  What is **Stack**?
	- ***Stack*** is a linear data structure that follows a particular order in which the operations are performed. The order may be ***LIFO(Last In First Out)*** or ***FILO(First In Last Out)***. ***LIFO***implies that the element that is inserted last, comes out first and ***FILO*** implies that the element that is inserted first, comes out last.


- ## Implementation Of **Stack**
	- Using [[Array Stack Implementation | Array]]
	- Using [[Linked List Stack implementation| Linked List]]

- ## Problems with **Stack**
	1. [[Parenthesis Matching using stack | Parenthesis matching]]
	2. [[Infix to Postfix using stack | Infix to Post-fix]]
	3.  [[Post-Fix evaluation]]
