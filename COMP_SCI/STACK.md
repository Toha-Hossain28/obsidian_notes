- ## [ ? ] What is Stack?
	- ***Stack*** is a linear data structure that follows a particular order in which the operations are performed. The order may be ***LIFO(Last In First Out)*** or ***FILO(First In Last Out)***. ***LIFO***implies that the element that is inserted last, comes out first and ***FILO*** implies that the element that is inserted first, comes out last.
